1. [Very Basics](01_VeryBasics)

    This describes all the basics of a neural network, how gradient descent works, learning rate, fully connected neurons, chain rule, etc.

2. [BackProp](02_BackProp/README.html)

    We built a Neural Network in a damn spreadsheet :)

3. [PyTorch 101](03_PyTorch101/README.html)

    Basics of PyTorch. Here i built a custom MNIST model, that can classify MNIST Image as well as do addition of that predicted image with a random integer.

4. [RNN & LSTMS](04_RNN_LSTM/README.md)

    Built an LSTM From Scratch and Trained an IMDb Sentiment analysis classifier using RNN & LSTM with PyTorch Text.

5. [LSTM & NLP Augmentation](05_NLP_Augment/README.html)

    Trained a LSTM Model on the SST Dataset. And did a lot of NLP Augmentations.

6. [Encoder Decoder](06_Encoder_Decoder/index.html)

    A Simple Encoder-Decoder Architecture, but for Classification ! I got to learn how encoder-decoder's work, and how the feature vector is used to compress and extract information :)

7. [Seq2Seq](07_Seq2Seq/index.html)

    Simple Sequence-to-Sequence Model for Question Answer and Similar Question Generation

    Also includes a redo of `5` without any augmentation. [05 Redo](07_Seq2Seq/07_SST_Redo.html)

8. [TorchText](08_TorchText/index.html)

    Introduction to the new TorchText APIs, and deprecation of `torchtext.legacy`

    Here we convert few notebooks with legacy code to the modern torchtext `0.9.0+`

9. [NLP Evaluation Metrics](09_NLP_Evaluation/index.html)

    Classification Metrics: F1, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix

    Machine Translation Metrics: Perplexity, BLEU, BERTScore

10. [Seq2Seq w/ Attention](10_Seq2Seq_Attention/index.html)

    Here we modified the Seq2Seq model to use attention mechanism.

11. [Attention Advanced](11_Attention_Advanced/index.html)

    Turns out there are a lot of things to learn about attention mechanism.
    There's the Bahdanau et al. paper, and the Luong et al. paper. In this assignment we implement a version of the Luong general attention model.

12. [Attention Is All You Need](12_Attention_Is_All_You_Need/index.html)

    A Vanilla Implementation of AIAYN Paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)
